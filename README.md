# chrome_translation_switcher_for_windows
This utility toggles between translated and original text using Google Chrome's translation feature. It operates through image recognition. If multiple instances of Google Chrome are running, it attempts to execute on the window with the highest Z-order. It might be convenient to register the output binary (chrome_translation_switcher_for_windows.exe) as a keyboard shortcut.


# How to Use
First, compile using Visual Studio or a similar tool (this will likely fail on the first attempt).  
Next, save the translation icon found in the Chrome's URL bar as a BMP 24-bit format image in the same directory as the executable binary file. Afterward, each time you run the output binary (chrome_translation_switcher_for_windows.exe), it will perform the designated operation.
