# chrome_translation_switcher_for_windows
Switch between enable/original text of Google Chrome's translation function using image recognition.    

# How to use
The first compilation will always fail. After that, save the translation icon in the URL bar of Chrome to the directory with the executable binary file in BMP24bit format.  
Output binary (chrome_translation_switcher_for_windows.exe) I think it would be useful to register it as a keyboard shortcut.
